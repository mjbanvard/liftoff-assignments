## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide information for patients who are afflicted with one or more of the following disorders: diabetes (type 1 and 2), hypertension, and celiac disorder. The application aims to provide a number of recipes for meals that are compatible with patient disorders. Users will fill out a questionnaire where they list their disorders, select foods that they are particlarly fond of, and select foods that they do not wish to eat. The application will filter recipes by these answers and then present them to users.

Additionally, the application will assist users in finding patient care within a radius of a certain zip code. Patient care can vary from inpatient hospitals to outpatient clinics.
### Features
User login: users will be able to create and delete their own accounts and store their disorder information and food preferences to databases connected to said accounts.
Find recipes: users will take a survey that does NOT require user signup or login. this survey will query users for their disorders, favored foods, and least favored foots. recipes based on these answers will be pulled from databases.
Find healthcare options: users will be able to search for nearby doctors, clinicians, and other patient care options within a radius of a zip via a Google Maps widget.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to review and re-teach myself JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular in order to work on the front-end, which will connect to a Java-based back-end. I will also have to learn how to connect my front-end to my back-end, as that was not covered in LC101.
